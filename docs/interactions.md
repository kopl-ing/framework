# Interactions

In Kopling interactions represent a specific type of interaction between one or more users. 

Interactions are listed on the main index of your community. Plugins can add additional interactions.

## Creating your own

Interactions needs to be part of a [Plugin][plugin]. This allows them to be registered.
